This README describes the Python bindings for Brian Gladman's AES module.

These bindings are compatible with Python 2.7+ (including Python 3).

You can build a binary distribution like this:
    $ python setup.py bdist

Or, for development work:
    $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Usage is fairly straightforward; see demo.py for an example.

The included test suite is not intended to be a complete implementation of
the NIST test vectors.  Rather, it is used to verify the correctness of the
Python wrappers around the AES function calls.

To build the binding in Visual Studio it is necessary to set this line:

    <PYTHON_VERSION>37</PYTHON_VERSION>

in the python_version.props file (in the aes\python_binding directory) to
identify the Python version for the build (the first two digits of the
version number without the decimal point, i.e. 37 identifies Python 3.7).
